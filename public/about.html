    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Florian Sturce, a student currently studying in the IT field. I’ve
      always had a passion for solving problems, which is what led me to pursue
      a career in IT. I’m driven by curiosity and enjoy tackling challenges
      head-on, which has helped me thrive in my studies so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to my academic interests, I also enjoy working in teams and
      believe that collaboration is key to success. My previous experience in
      basketball taught me the importance of teamwork and working towards a
      common goal, which I apply in both my studies and personal life.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to finish my studies, become highly skilled in the IT field,
      and eventually work in an IT-related job where I can continue to grow and
      contribute to innovative projects. I’m excited to learn more every day and
      stay motivated to reach my goals.
